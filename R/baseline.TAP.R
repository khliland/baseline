# (i) A first approximation of the baseline equation was selected as the straight line between points A and B (see Fig. 2).
# (ii) Based on the first approximation of the baseline equation, the phase change progress parameter was calculated using Eq. (2).
# (iii) An updated equation of the baseline was calculated using Eq. (3) and the phase change progress parameter equation from step (ii).
# (iv) The baseline equation from step (iii) was compared (point by point) with the one from the previous iteration. If the convergence criterion was met (the difference between every baseline value corresponding to two successive iterations was less than 0.1%) the procedure was stopped and the final baseline equation was selected. If the convergence criterion was not fulfilled then a new iteration was carried out from step (ii) until convergence was achieved

#' @description An implementation of Roman Svoboda and Jirí Málek's algorithm for baseline
#' identification in kinetic anlaysis of derivative kinetic data.

#' @details (i) A first approximation of the baseline equation is selected as the
#' straight line between start and end of the curve. (ii) Based on the first
#' approximation of the baseline equation, the phase change progress parameter
#' is calculated. (iii) An updated equation of the baseline is calculated and
#' the phase change progress parameter equation from step (ii). (iv) The
#' baseline equation from step (iii) is compared (point by point) with the one
#' from the previous iteration. If the convergence criterion is met (the
#' difference between every baseline value corresponding to two successive
#' iterations was less than 0.1\%) the procedure is stopped and the final
#' baseline equation is selected. If the convergence criterion is not fulfilled
#' then a new iteration is carried out from step (ii) until convergence was
#' achieved.
